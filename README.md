◦ Platform to digitize India’s scrap ecosystem by connecting users with verified vendors.
◦ Developed a full-stack web application with separate User and Vendor dashboards integrated with a
PostgreSQL database. Enabled Users to select scrap categories and place orders, while Vendors could
view nearby orders (matched via zip code), choose scrap to purchase, and make payments using Web3
wallets such as Phantom and MetaMask.
◦ Tech stack: NextJS, PostgreSQL, TypeScript. Integrated blockchain and Web3 wallet payments.
